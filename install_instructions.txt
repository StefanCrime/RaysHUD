STEFAN B.'s HUD (RaysHUD modified)

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Use WinRAR to extract the files.
2. Create a custom folder inside your tf. (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\)
3. Copy-Paste the inside of the entire folder inside the custom folder. (Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)
4. If you done it good it should look something like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\StefanBHUD
5. If you already have a custom folder, make sure you backup/save the files inside of it. Also backup/save your cfg folder. (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg).
6. Open TF2. Everything should be changed now.
